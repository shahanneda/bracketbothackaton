# The adaruit neopixel library doesnt work on the PI5, someone wrote this: https://pypi.org/project/Pi5Neo/
# use the MOSI pin (GPIO10) on PI5 for this script to work.
# NOTE: the neopixel strips are directional, they have an input direction and output direction. Check your wiring.
# NOTE: the Pi5Neo library is not working well, i had to patch it, in its source for the update_led function, theres a time.sleep(0.1), i just made that 0.01
